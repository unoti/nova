# Nova

**Nova** is a powerful Elixir library designed to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into enterprise-grade business workflows. Built on Elixir's concurrency model and the robust Erlang VM, Nova provides a scalable, fault-tolerant foundation for AI-powered applications.

## Overview

Nova makes it easy to incorporate large language models (LLMs) and other AI technologies into your business processes with minimal friction. The library provides elegant abstractions that enable:

- Multi-agent workflows with complex coordination patterns
- Interactive, stateful conversations with AI systems
- Seamless integration with popular LLM providers
- Fault tolerance and resiliency for AI operations
- Operational visibility and observability

## Why Nova?

Nova leverages Elixir's strengths in building distributed, concurrent systems to address common challenges in production AI deployments:

- **Scalability**: Handle high throughput of AI requests across distributed systems
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in supervision strategies and circuit breakers for AI operations
- **Concurrency**: Efficient handling of parallel AI workflows and conversations
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics, tracing, and logging for AI interactions
- **Extensibility**: Flexible plugin architecture to integrate with various LLM providers and tools

## Status

Nova is currently in active development. We're working on establishing core abstractions and an extensible foundation for enterprise-ready AI integrations.
