# Nova

**Nova** is a powerful Elixir library designed to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into enterprise-grade business workflows. Built on Elixir's concurrency model and the robust Erlang VM, Nova provides a scalable, fault-tolerant foundation for AI-powered applications.

## Overview

Nova makes it easy to incorporate large language models (LLMs) and other AI technologies into your business processes with minimal friction. The library provides elegant abstractions that enable:

- Multi-agent workflows with complex coordination patterns
- Interactive, stateful conversations with AI systems
- Seamless integration with popular LLM providers
- Fault tolerance and resiliency for AI operations
- Operational visibility and observability

## Why Nova?

Nova leverages Elixir's strengths in building distributed, concurrent systems to address common challenges in production AI deployments:

- **Scalability**: Handle high throughput of AI requests across distributed systems
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in supervision strategies and circuit breakers for AI operations
- **Concurrency**: Efficient handling of parallel AI workflows and conversations
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics, tracing, and logging for AI interactions
- **Extensibility**: Flexible plugin architecture to integrate with various LLM providers and tools

## Status

Nova is currently in the early design phase. We're iterating on the design and vision documents to establish a solid foundation before implementation begins.

## Design Principles

Nova follows a set of core [design principles](docs/design_principles.md) that guide our development approach. These principles emphasize:

- Separation of business logic from infrastructure code
- Building abstractions that make complex problems simple
- Loose coupling and composability for flexibility
- AI-specific layered design patterns

Understanding these principles will help you grasp the architectural decisions behind Nova.

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine vision and design documents
2. Establish core architecture and component interfaces
3. Implement foundational modules for LLM integration
4. Develop example workflows showing common AI business integration patterns
5. Ensure clean separation between public components and proprietary business logic

The public Nova library will focus on providing general-purpose AI integration tools, while specialized business logic will be maintained in a separate private repository.
