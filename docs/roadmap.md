# Nova: Roadmap & Milestones

This document outlines our planned development trajectory for Nova, from initial concept to production-ready framework.

## Milestone 1: Foundation (Q2 2025)

**Goal**: Establish core abstractions and basic LLM integration capabilities.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Core API for interacting with LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Conversation state management
- Basic prompt templating
- Simple content generation workflows
- Initial documentation and examples

**Technical Focus**:
- Clean, intuitive API design
- Robust error handling
- Unit and integration test framework

## Milestone 2: Multi-Agent Framework (Q3 2025)

**Goal**: Enable complex multi-agent workflows and conversations.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Agent definition and specialization system
- Inter-agent communication patterns
- Workflow orchestration
- Tool integration framework for agents
- Memory and context management across agents

**Technical Focus**:
- Ensuring message passing reliability
- Optimizing for complex workflows
- Building flexible agent hierarchies

## Milestone 3: Enterprise Readiness (Q4 2025)

**Goal**: Prepare Nova for production deployment in enterprise environments.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive observability (metrics, tracing, logging)
- Rate limiting and cost management
- Security features (content filtering, PII protection)
- Caching and performance optimizations
- High availability patterns
- Extended documentation and enterprise deployment guides

**Technical Focus**:
- Reliability under load
- Operational visibility
- Security and compliance

## Milestone 4: Ecosystem Expansion (Q1 2026)

**Goal**: Broaden Nova's capabilities and build a vibrant community.

**Key Deliverables**:

## Stretch Goals

Future directions we're considering beyond our initial roadmap:

1. **Nova UI**: A web interface for designing, testing, and monitoring AI workflows
2. **Nova Studio**: Development environment optimizations for AI workflow creation
3. **Domain-Specific Agents**: Pre-built agent templates for common business domains
4. **Hybrid AI Workflows**: Combining LLMs with other AI techniques (vision, speech, etc.)
5. **Edge Deployment**: Running Nova workflows on edge devices with limited connectivity
